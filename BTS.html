Under BTS, he has sung three solo songs; the first, pop track "Begin" from the 2016 album Wings, told his story of moving to Seoul at a young age to become an idol and expresses his gratitude towards his fellow members for taking care of him during that time. The second, a future bass song titled "Euphoria", was released with an accompanying nine-minute short film on April 5, 2018 as the introduction to the third part of BTS' "Love Yourself" series. The full studio version was included on their Love Yourself: Answer compilation album, released August 24, 2018. "Euphoria" was produced by DJ Swivel and charted at number five on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The third solo, off the band's 2020 studio album Map of the Soul: 7, is a strobing R&B song about forgoing teenage experiences because of his career. "My Time" charted at number 84 on the US Billboard Hot 100. "Euphoria" and "My Time" are the first and second longest charting solo tracks among K-pop singers on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart, having spent 72 and 68 weeks respectively on the ranking.

            Jungkook has been credited as the main producer for two of BTS' songs: "Love is Not Over" and "Magic Shop".

A month after its release, The Guardian added "Singularity" to its "Top 50 songs for the month of June 2018" playlist and Billboard included it in their Critics' list of the "Top 50 BTS songs" at number 28. Overall, "Singularity" was generally well received by critics and as a result was mentioned on several year end Critics' Choice lists. The New York Times ranked it twentieth on its list of "The 65 Best Songs of 2018" alongside "Fake Love", LA Times Pop Music Critic Mikael Wood named it the fourth "best and most replay worthy song of 2018",[18] and Guardian Music Critic Laura Snapes included it as one of her favourite tracks in their “Best Music of 2018: Albums and Tracks" list.

            Park Ji-min (Korean: 박지민) was born on October 13, 1995 in Geumjeong District, Busan, South Korea. On June 13, 2013, Jimin made his debut as a member of BTS with the release of the single "No More Dream". In the group, Jimin holds the position of vocalist and dancer. Under BTS, he has released three solo songs: "Lie", "Serendipity", and "Filter". "Lie" was released in 2016, as part of the group's second Korean studio album, Wings. It was described as stunning and dramatic, conveying dark undertones and emotions that helped reflect the overall concept of the album. In contrast, "Serendipity", released on the Love Yourself: Her (2017) extended play (EP), was soft and sensual, unraveling the joy, conviction, and curiosity of love. "Filter", from the group's 2020 studio album, Map of the Soul: 7, was very different from its predecessor, with a distinct Latin pop-esque flair and lyrics that reflected on the different sides of himself that Jimin shows to the world and those around him.

            "Serendipity" and "Lie" both surpassed fifty million streams on Spotify in 2018, followed shortly thereafter by the former's full length version from BTS' Love Yourself: Answer (2018) compilation album, which achieved the milestone in early 2019. With this, Jimin set a new record as the only Korean artist to have three solo tracks accumulate over 50 million streams each—previously Psy was the only Korean artist to ever cross the 50 million streams mark with "Gangnam Style" (2012) and "Gentleman" (2013). Both songs were also the only solos by a BTS member included in the Official Chart Company's list of the top 20 most streamed BTS songs in the United Kingdom as of October 2018, ranking at number 17 and 19 respectively. In April 2019, the list was expanded to reflect the top 40, and both tracks ranked at numbers 18 and 20 respectively, the highest of five solo songs included that year.

J-Hope released his first solo mixtape, Hope World, worldwide on March 1, 2018. It was accompanied by a music video for the lead single "Daydream". A music video for the B-side "Airplane" was later released on March 6. The mixtape debuted at number 63 and peaked at number 38 on the Billboard 200, making him the highest charting Korean solo act on the chart up to that point. Hope World also peaked at number 35 on the Canadian Albums chart, and number 19 on the US Top Rap Albums chart. Three mixtape tracks, "Daydream", "Hope World", and "Hangsang", charted on the World Digital Songs Chart, at number 3, 16, and 24 respectively. The following week, the tracks rose to number 1, 6, and 11, with three additional tracks off of Hope World, "Airplane", "Base Line", and "P.O.P (Piece of Peace) pt. 1" arriving on the chart at number 5, 6, and 12, respectively. "Daydream" peaking atop the chart made J-Hope one of only ten Korean artists, including BTS, to reach number one. The success of his solo debut lead him to rank at number 3 on the Emerging Artists Chart, and 97 on the Artist 100 Chart for the week of March 10, later peaking at number 91 for the week of March 17. He is the fifth Korean artist, and the second Korean soloist after Psy, to place on the Artist 100. The mixtape charted in ten countries worldwide, with "Daydream" charting in three. It was ranked at number 5 on Billboard magazine's year-end World Albums Chart.

            Kim Nam-joon (Korean: 김남준; born September 12, 1994), better known by his stage name RM (formerly Rap Monster), is a South Korean rapper, songwriter and record producer. He is the leader of the South Korean boy group BTS. In 2015, he released his first solo mixtape, RM. In October 2018, his second mixtape, Mono, was the highest-charting album by a Korean soloist on the Billboard 200 chart, having peaked at 26. He has recorded with artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, and Lil Nas X. In 2009, RM auditioned for Big Deal Records, passing the first round along with Samuel Seo but failing the second round as he forgot all his lyrics. However, following the audition, rapper Sleepy exchanged contact information with RM, who he later mentioned to Big Hit Entertainment producer Pdogg. In 2010, Sleepy contacted RM, encouraging him to audition for Big Hit CEO Bang Si-hyuk. Bang offered RM a spot at the record label, and, without his parents knowledge, RM accepted the offer immediately. The interaction caused Bang and Pdogg to start production of a hip hop group, which eventually became idol group BTS. RM joined Big Hit Entertainment shortly after at age 16. During his career as an idol, he enrolled at Global Cyber University. As of 2020, he is enrolled at Hanyang Cyber University, pursuing a Master of Business Administration in Advertising and Media.
